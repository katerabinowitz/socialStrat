<h2> Social Stratification in the United States</h2>
<p>Income inequality is at its highest point in recent history, and awareness of the issue is growing proportionally. The below visualization shows how groups of Americans are faring in terms of several social indicators. Much of this information is discussed in classrooms and the media. However, the numbers, percentages, and median figures can be confusing and hard to relate to one another. This visualization attempts to overcome this problem by presenting the data all together across income, education, gender, and household type.</p>

<p> Each 
<svg height="12" width="12">
  <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="3" stroke="gray" stroke-width="3" fill="gray" />
</svg> is 200,000 people.
</p>

<p>Below shows the number of Americans in each income category. Select from the dropdowns to see how income breaks down across across different groups of Americans. Click on a dot to show the count across categories.</p> 

<p>See how income looks across:

Note: The data above shows adults responsible for their own well-being. Individuals over eighteen living with parents, elderly individuals living with relatives, and people in institutions such as the armed forces, prisons, and mental hospitals, are not included. Simplifying assumptions were made in the grouping of people and visualization. Gay couples are not represented, though their numbers are large enough to represent ten dots. Interracial couples are also not represented.</p>
